Define the function find_peak(list_of_integers) that takes a list of unsorted integers as input.

Find the middle element of the list using len(list_of_integers)//2. We'll compare this element with its neighbors to find a peak.

Compare the middle element with its neighbors. If it is greater than both its neighbors, then it is a peak. Return the middle element.

If the middle element is less than its left neighbor, we can discard the right half of the list (as the peak must be on the left half). Recursively call find_peak() on the left half of the list.

If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, we can discard the left half of the list (as the peak must be on the right half). Recursively call find_peak() on the right half of the list.
